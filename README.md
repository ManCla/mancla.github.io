# Welcome!

## Short Bio

I am a Research Associate (post-doc) at the [Software Verification and Validation Lab](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/research-groups/svv/), University of Luxembourg, headed by prof. [Domenico Bianculli](https://people.svv.lu/bianculli/index.html), since January 2023.

I received my PhD from Lund University, department of [Automatic Control](https://control.lth.se/), working with [Martina Maggio](https://www.martinamaggio.com/main/).
During my PhD, I started collaborating with the [Software Verification and Validation Lab](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/research-groups/svv/) at the University of Luxembourg working with [Seung Yeob Shin](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/people/seung-yeob-shin/), [Domenico Bianculli](https://people.svv.lu/bianculli/) and [Lionel Briand](https://www.lbriand.info/).
This collaboration led to my current position.
Previously, I obtained my master and bachelor degrees in Automation and Control Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/home-page), respectively in 2017 and 2015.

## Research Interest

I do research on Software Engineering for **Cyber-Physical Systems**, focusing on their interdisciplinary nature.
I leverage my background in Control Engineering to enhance the **Software Verification and Validation** techniques that are applied to such systems.

During my PhD I also worked on the testing of Self-Adaptive Software and on the design of control algorithms robust to the non-idealities of their real-time execution.
